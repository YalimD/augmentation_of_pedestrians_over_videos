# Augmenting Virtual Agents into Real Crowd Videos Using Unity

This project aims to augment a virtual crowd into a real one extracted from given video.
The project is written on Unity using C#.

For collision detection between virtual agents and the static and dynamic obstacles (including real pedestrians) we use Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) proposed by Dinesh Manocha et al.

We use Unity's PathFinding library for global path planning of virtual agents.
